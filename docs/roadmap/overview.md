To create a GitHub bot like `@PRfectbot` that automatically fixes errors in pull requests (PRs) when mentioned, commits the fixes, and updates the PR, you'll need to build a system that integrates tightly with GitHub's APIs, listens for mentions, analyzes code, applies fixes, and interacts with Git.

Here's a step-by-step **workflow and integration guide**:

---

## üîÅ **Overview Workflow**

1. **User mentions `@PRfectbot` in a PR comment**
2. **Bot detects the mention via GitHub Webhook**
3. **Bot fetches the PR's code**
4. **Bot runs automated fixes (e.g., linters, formatters, static analysis)**
5. **Bot commits the fixed code to the PR branch**
6. **Bot posts a comment on the PR summarizing changes**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Required Components

### 1. **GitHub App / Bot**

- Create a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app)
- Install it in your org or repository
- Set it to listen for:

  - `issue_comment` (for PR comments)
  - `pull_request` (to read/commit to PRs)

### 2. **Webhook Server**

- Host a server (e.g., with **FastAPI**, Node.js, etc.) to receive GitHub webhook events.
- Set up endpoints to handle:

  - `POST /webhook` (where GitHub will send events)

### 3. **PR Comment Detection**

- When a comment is received, check:

  - Is it on a pull request?
  - Does it mention `@PRfectbot`?
  - Does it request a fix? (e.g., "fix errors")

### 4. **Clone and Analyze PR Code**

- Use the PR's branch ref to clone the repo:

  ```bash
  git clone --single-branch --branch <branch> https://github.com/owner/repo.git
  ```

- Run automated tools:

  - Linters: `eslint`, `black`, `ruff`, etc.
  - Type checkers: `mypy`, `pyright`
  - Formatters or custom scripts

### 5. **Fix and Commit**

- After changes are made:

  ```bash
  git commit -am "fix: automated fixes by PRfectbot"
  git push origin <branch>
  ```

### 6. **Comment Back on the PR**

- Use the GitHub API to post a comment like:

  > ‚úÖ Fixed errors and updated this PR automatically.

## üîê Permissions Required by the GitHub App

- `contents:write` ‚Äî to push changes
- `pull_requests:read` ‚Äî to read PR metadata
- `issues:read` and `issues:write` ‚Äî to detect and respond to mentions

---

## üß† Bonus Features

- Support natural language commands like:

  > `@PRfectbot fix the PEP8 issues here please`

- Show a diff summary
- Post warnings for things it couldn't fix

---

## üöÄ Tech Stack Recommendations

- **Backend**: FastAPI (you're already skilled there)
- **Bot Logic**: Python scripts with linters/autoformatters
- **Git Operations**: Use `GitPython` or shell commands
- **GitHub API**: `PyGithub` or direct REST/GraphQL calls
- **Deployment**: Docker + Fly.io / Railway / AWS / Cloud Run

**Note:** The auto-fix on @PRfectbot mention feature is being integrated soon! A placeholder is present in the code and will be replaced with the full implementation.
